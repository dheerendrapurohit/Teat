3.Async and Await:
* These are the keywords in JavaScript which is used to handle Asynchronous type of data.
* Async keyword makes the function Asynchronous.
* Async function return Promise.
* Await keyword must be inside in Async function
* Await keyword await only for the promise But it allows other statements or tasks to 
execute
* If you want to handle the errors, we use try catch block, where try block handles the 
resolved data and catch block handles the rejected 
* Async and await are syntactic sugar for promises.

Aysnc function getdata()
{
Try
{ 
Let users = await fetch(“api.github.com/users”)
Users = await users.json()
Users.map({avatar_url})=>
{
Document.body.innerhtml += `<img src = ${avatar_url}>
}
}
Catch (err)
{
Clg(err.messge)
}}
getdata()

5.In JavaScript, we can achieve the functionality of positional and keyword arguments by using a combination of default parameters, destructuring, and object literals.

11. type of console.log("22"+2) is string.

12.Their are two ways to read json file using javascript,

*Reading a JSON file from a server:When working on the client side, we can use the Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest to read a JSON file from a server.

*Reading a JSON file from the filesystem:When working with Node.js, we can use the fs module to read a JSON file from the filesystem.
